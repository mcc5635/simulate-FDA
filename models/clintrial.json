Sarcopenia, characterized by decreased muscle mass, is prevalent among older adults and poses a significant risk for falls. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of the SARC-F and SARC-CalF questionnaires, along with calf circumference measurements, in screening for sarcopenia among Thai community-dwelling older adults, following the Asian Working Group on Sarcopenia (AWGS) 2019 criteria.",

This cross-sectional study targeted Thai adults aged 60 years and older, conducted between March 2021 and August 2022. Participants were sampled using a multi-level sampling technique to ensure representativeness from community-dwelling older adults across 12 provinces, encompassing Thailand's six primary geographical regions.\n\nParticipants were evaluated for possible sarcopenia or sarcopenia, according to AWGS 2019 criteria, by using SARC-F questionnaire, calf circumference measurement, SARC-CalF questionnaire, and appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM)."

            "detailedDescription": "Induction of labor is frequently performed in all obstetric clinics for various indications, with a worldwide spectrum ranging from 1.4 to 35%. Failed IOL has been defined in many different ways. It has been defined as a dilatation of less than 4 cm despite administration of oxytocin for 12 hours±3 hours (target 200-225 MVU or 3 contractions/10 min), induction of labor with oxytocin for at least 12-18 hours (after rupture of membranes) and a latent phase lasting 24 hours or longer, primarily considering fetal and maternal well-being. In some sources, it is defined as failure to achieve regular (e.g. every 3 minutes) uterine contractions and cervical changes with artificial rupture of membranes after at least 6-8 hours of oxytocin maintenance dose. For this reason, various subjective \\& ultrasonographic parameters used to predict induction success are of great importance for the evaluation of the cervix. Bishop scoring, which is a traditional and subjective method, is more frequently evaluated with cervical length, which has taken its place in preterm labor, and various ultrasonographic evaluations such as Uterocervical angle (UCA), Posterior cervical angle (PCA), cervical elastography, transvulvar ultrasonography, which have recently increased in popularity, have gained importance and led us to evaluate these parameters in our clinic.\n\nThe relationship between the angles between the uterus and cervix and labor has been known for some time."

            "detailedDescription": "Eligible healthy participants with normal blood pressure (SBP: 110-139 mmHg; DBP: 70-89 mmHg) were randomized into dose cohorts 1 - 240 mg. Eligible healthy participants with elevated blood pressure (SBP: 139 - 159 mmHg; DBP: 75 - 95 mmHg) were randomized into dose cohorts 450 and 600 mg. Each participant received a subcutaneous single dose of either XXB750 or placebo. In total, the duration of the study was 151 days, including the full Screening period of up to 28 days, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics assessments over a period of 91 days, and a 30-day safety follow up call after the end of study visit.\n\nSentinel dosing will be applied in this FIH study at each new dose level to ensure participant's safety and minimize the number of participants that may experience symptomatic hypotension, especially for sustained periods of time attributing to the long acting nature of XXB750 and the sustained pharmacological effects on BP at higher doses. The 10-day safety monitoring for the sentinel cohort is considered sufficient based on the predicted mean Tmax (4.5 days) in humans."

This was an open-label, randomized, single-dose, two-period, two-sequence, two-way crossover study under fasting conditions which included 28 healthy adult male and female subjects. The participating subjects were required to have an 8 hours overnight fast and in the next morning (first day of period) were given orally the test drug (rivaroxaban 10 mg film-coated tablet produced by PT Dexa Medica) or the comparator drug (Xarelto® 10 mg Film-Coated Tablet, manufactured by Bayer AG, Germany, imported by PT Bayer Indonesia, Indonesia) with total 200 mL of water. The subject's oral cavity was checked thoroughly to confirm complete medication and fluid consumption after dosing. Blood samples were drawn before taking the drug (control), and at 0.33, 0.67, 1.00, 1.33, 1.67, 2.00, 2.33, 2.67, 3.00, 3.33, 3.67, 4.00, 4.33, 4.67, 5.00, 6.00, 8.00, 12.00, 24.00 and 36.00 hours after drug administration. These blood samples were used to investigate the pharmacokinetic parameters of rivaroxaban following single dose administration."

This was an open-label, randomized, single-dose, two-period, two-sequence, two-way crossover study under fed conditions which included 28 healthy adult male and female subjects. The participating subjects were given orally the test drug (rivaroxaban 20 mg film-coated tablet produced by PT Dexa Medica) or the comparator drug (Xarelto® 20 mg Film-Coated Tablet, manufactured by Bayer AG, Germany, imported by PT Bayer Indonesia, Indonesia) with total 200 mL of water 30 minutes after the subjects have consumed a standardized high fat meal as breakfast meal in the first day of each period. Subjects had to ingest meal within 30 minutes or less.\n\nStart and end of breakfast were documented. The subject's oral cavity was checked thoroughly to confirm complete medication and fluid consumption after dosing. Blood samples were drawn before taking the drug (control), and at 0.50, 1.00, 1.33, 1.67, 2.00, 2.33, 2.67, 3.00, 3.33, 3.67, 4.00, 4.33, 4.67, 5.00, 5.50, 6.00, 8.00, 12.00, 24.00 and 36.00 hours after drug administration. These blood samples were used to investigate the pharmacokinetic parameters of rivaroxaban following single dose administration. The plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban were determined by using a validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (UPLC-MS/MS)."

This was an open-label, randomized, single-dose, four-period, two-sequence, fully replicate study under fasting conditions which included 28 healthy adult male subjects. The participating subjects were required to have an 8 hours overnight fast and in the next morning (first day of period) were given orally the test drug (tamsulosin 0.4 mg sustained release film coated tablet produced by PT Dexa Medica) or the comparator drug (Harnal® OCAS 0.4 mg Prolonged Release Tablet produced by Astellas Pharma Europe B.V., The Netherlands, imported by PT Combiphar, Indonesia) with total 200 mL of water. The subjects' oral cavity was checked thoroughly to confirm complete medication and fluid consumption after dosing. Blood samples were drawn before taking the drug (control), and at 1.00, 2.00, 3.00, 4.00, 5.00, 6.00, 7.00, 8.00, 9.00, 10.00, 11.00, 12.00, 18.00, 24.00, 36.00, 48.00 and 72.00 hours after drug administration. These blood samples were used to investigate the pharmacokinetic parameters of Tamsulosin following single dose administration. The plasma concentrations of Tamsulosin were determined by using validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectroscopy detection (UPLC-MS/MS method)."

            "briefSummary": "The goal of this observational study is to analyze how spinal alignment changes when walking compared to standing still in adults aged 50 to 80 years who have sagittal imbalance. The main questions we aim to answer are:\n\n1. Do patients with radiological parameters indicative of sagittal imbalance experience a statistically significant deterioration in sagittal balance during walking compared to a control group?\n2. Do radiographs taken after six minutes of walking provide comparable results to dynamic measurements during the walking test?\n3. Do patients with a greater deterioration in sagittal balance during walking show poorer clinical self-assessment scores?\n4. Is there a significant correlation between parameters obtained using established diagnostic methods and the degree of sagittal balance deterioration during walking?\n\nParticipants will be divided into two groups: patients with radiological indicators of sagittal imbalance and a control group of healthy individuals with back pain of similar age. Participants will:\n\n1. Complete questionnaires about their back pain and mobility.\n2. Have X-ray images taken of their spine before and after walking for six minutes.\n3. Undergo muscle strength tests and gait analysis using motion capture and electromyography (EMG) to monitor muscle activity while walking."

Participants walk for 6 minutes between two cones set 7 meters apart, while a 12-camera Qualisys Motion Capture System tracks marker movements for comprehensive kinematic analysis. Data are recorded at five key moments: standing before and after the test, and during three phases of gait (at the beginning, middle, and end). Participants are barefoot and dressed in underwear for accurate measurement. Static recordings before and after walking involve stepping on a tensiometric force plate to measure the center of gravity. Before the test, participants perform stretching exercises to ensure consistent preparation.",

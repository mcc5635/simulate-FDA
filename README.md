        - Determine which trials failed and which succeeded during the past ten years.
   - #2 Stock prices from a variety of sources (NASDAQ, NYSE etc) that ran trials
        - Make graphs showing how the stock price of the company that ran the trial changed in the 180 days leading up to trial results being posted to ClinicalTrials.gov.
